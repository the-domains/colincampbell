  Get Nima Arkani-Hamed going on the subject of the universe-not difficult-and
  he'll talk for as many minutes or hours as it takes to transport you to the
  edge of human understanding, and then he'll talk you past the edge, beyond
  Einstein, beyond space-time and quantum mechanics and all those tired tropes
  of 20th-century physics, to a spectacular new vision of how everything works.
